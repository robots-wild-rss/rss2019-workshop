# **Robots in the Wild: Challenges in Deploying Robust Autonomy for Robotic Exploration**

## **Call for Papers**

We are soliciting extended abstracts in the RSS format (4-6 pages plus references). We encourage the submission of early ideas, late-breaking results, or open research questions that are likely to generate interesting discussions. Accepted contributions will be presented as a short spotlight talk<span style="color:red">**??**</span> and in a poster session<span style="color:red">**??**</span>. <span style="color:red">**??**</span> particularly relevant contributions will be selected to be presented in <span style="color:red">**??**</span> minute talks. 


## **Topics**

1. System consideration for exploration of extreme environments such as underwater and benthic habitats, hot-springs, volcanoes, asteroids, and planetary surfaces.
2. Challenges in environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, and disaster response.
3. Multi-robot learning and coordination for environmental modelling.
4. Underground and underwater mapping, space missions and planetary robots.
5. Novelty, anomaly, and change detection.
6. Decision-theoretic approaches for active sensing and physical sample (specimen) retrieval.
7. Sampling algorithms and strategies, e.g., opportunistic sampling, non-myopic sampling.
8. Online exploration algorithms: theory, experiments and field studies.


## **Important Dates**

* Submission deadline: <span style="color:red">**??**</span>, 2019 (Anywhere on Earth).
* Notification of acceptance (rolling basis): May 31, 2019.
* Camera-ready paper due: <span style="color:red">**??**</span>, 2019.
* Workshop day: June 23, 2019.
