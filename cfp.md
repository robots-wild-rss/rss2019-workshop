# **Robots in the Wild: Challenges in Deploying Robust Autonomy for Robotic Exploration**

## **Call for Papers**

We are soliciting extended abstracts in the RSS format (4-6 pages plus references). We encourage the submission of early ideas, late-breaking results, or open research questions that are likely to generate interesting discussions. Submissions will be accepted on a rolling basis and reviewed by experts in the field. Accepted contributions will be presented as a 20 minute spotlight talk or a 5 minute lightning talk. All speakers will participate in a poster session.


## **Topics**

1. System consideration for exploration of extreme environments such as underwater and benthic habitats, hot-springs, volcanoes, asteroids, and planetary surfaces.
2. Challenges in environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, and disaster response.
3. Multi-robot learning and coordination for environmental modelling.
4. Underground and underwater mapping, space missions and planetary robots.
5. Novelty, anomaly, and change detection.
6. Decision-theoretic approaches for active sensing and physical sample (specimen) retrieval.
7. Sampling algorithms and strategies, e.g., opportunistic sampling, non-myopic sampling.
8. Online exploration algorithms: theory, experiments and field studies.


## **Important Dates**

* **Submission cut-off (extended)**: June 7, 2019 (Anywhere on Earth).
* **Notification of acceptance (rolling basis)**: within two weeks of submission, until June 10, 2019.
* **Camera-ready paper due**: June 15, 2019.
* **Workshop day**: June 23, 2019.
