# **Robots in the Wild: Challenges in Deploying Robust Autonomy for Robotic Exploration**

## **Abstract**

New advances in robust autonomy have increased our ability to adopt robotic systems for exploration of unstructured and uncertain environments. Particularly, successful field tests have demonstrated the tremendous potential of deploying robots for exploration and data collection tasks in extreme environments. However, various challenges exist, originating from algorithmic limitations, as well as environmental modeling, sensing, mobility, and communication constraints. A relevant selection of robotic systems, methods, and sensing devices can overcome these challenges. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers to discuss the following themes:

1. How can we define and address robot autonomy in unstructured and uncertain environments?
2. How can we tie together the categories of systems, methods, and devices to address relevant scientific questions? 
3. How can we deal with the algorithmic challenges from the perspective of planning, learning, and decision-making?


## **Topics**

1. System consideration for exploration of extreme environments such as underwater and benthic habitats, hot-springs, volcanoes, asteroids, and planetary surfaces.
2. Challenges in environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, and disaster response.
3. Multi-robot learning and coordination for environmental modelling.
4. Underground and underwater mapping, space missions and planetary robots.
5. Novelty, anomaly, and change detection.
6. Decision-theoretic approaches for active sensing and physical sample (specimen) retrieval.
7. Sampling algorithms and strategies, e.g., opportunistic sampling, non-myopic sampling.
8. Online exploration algorithms: theory, experiments and field studies.


## **Panel Discussion**

* Robotics -- under-delivered or surpassed expectations in science autonomy? 
* AI -- what is its role in exploration research and big-data driven discovery?
* Hype cycles, crystal ball session -- what can we take from self-driving car research?
* Is Earth observation lagging behind consumer technology? How can roboticists help bridge the gap?
