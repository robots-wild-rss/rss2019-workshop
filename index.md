# **Robots in the Wild: Challenges in Deploying Robust Autonomy for Robotic Exploration**

## **Abstract**

New advances in robust autonomy have increased our ability to adopt robotic systems for exploration of unstructured and uncertain environments. Particularly, successful field tests have demonstrated the tremendous potential of deploying robots for exploration and data collection tasks in extreme environments. However, various challenges exist, originating from algorithmic limitations, as well as environmental modeling, sensing, mobility, and communication constraints. A relevant selection of robotic systems, methods, and sensing devices can overcome these challenges. 

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers to discuss the following themes:
```
1. How can we define and address robot autonomy in unstructured and uncertain environments?
2. How can we tie together the categories of systems, methods, and devices to address relevant scientific questions? 
3. How can we deal with the algorithmic challenges from the perspective of planning, learning, and decision-making?
```


## **Topics**

1. Environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, disaster response
2. Underground and underwater mapping, space missions and planetary robots
3. Novelty, anomaly, and change detection
4. Tomography and inverse models
5. Sampling algorithms and strategies, e.g., opportunistic, and non-myopic sampling
6. Exploration of extreme environments, system considerations, e.g., challenges in  sampling underwater and benthic environments, hot-springs, volcanoes, asteroids
7. Physical sample (specimen) collection for science autonomy


## **Panel Discussion**

* Robotics -- under-delivered or surpassed expectations in science autonomy? 
* What is the role of AI in exploration research and big-data driven discovery?
* Hype cycles, crystal ball session, what can we take from self-driving car research? 
* Is Earth observation lagging behind consumer technology? How can roboticists help bridge the gap?
