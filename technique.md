# **Robots in the Wild: Challenges in Deploying Robust Autonomy for Robotic Exploration**

## **Schedule**

TBD

## **Panel Discussion**

* Robotics -- under-delivered or surpassed expectations in science autonomy? 
* AI -- what is its role in exploration research and big-data driven discovery?
* Hype cycles, crystal ball session -- what can we take from self-driving car research?
* Is Earth observation lagging behind consumer technology? How can roboticists help bridge the gap?
