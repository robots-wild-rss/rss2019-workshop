Co-Robotic Exploration in Bandwidth Constrained Environments

Vision-based exploration of extreme environments with communication
bottlenecks, such as underwater,  is challenging due to lack of
availability of high-resolution mission state information to the human
operator. One approach to enable co-robotic exploration in such
conditions is to summarize visual data collected by the robot using
semantic scene map. Our work explores the use of an unsupervised
approach to learning a generative model of the sensor data that can
grow with the size and complexity of the observed input, and produce
compact scene maps that can be used for communicating the current
mission state. This talk will discuss the generative model along with
techniques to enable online, life-long learning of these models, and
extensions of the work to multi-robot environments.

Bio:
Dr. Yogesh Girdhar is currently an Assistant Scientist at the Applied
Ocean Physics & Engineering department at Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution (WHOI).  He received his BS and MS from Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, where he was awarded the Paul A. McGloin prize
for most outstanding academic achievement in Computer Science. He
received his Ph.D. from McGill University in, with the thesis titled
“Unsupervised Semantic Perception, Summarization, and Autonomous
Exploration for Robots in Unstructured Environments”, which received
the Honorable Mention for CIPPR Doctoral Dissertation Award. After his
Ph.D., Yogi was a Postdoctoral Scholar and FQRTN Postdoctoral Fellow
at WHOI. Yogesh is the PI of [WARPLab](http://warp.whoi.edu), which is
focused on developing smarter autonomous exploration robots that can
accelerate the scientific discovery process in extreme and challenging
environments, such as the deep sea.

Marine Robotics: Planning, Decision Making, and Human-Robot Learning

Underwater gliders, propeller-driven submersibles, and other marine robots are increasingly being tasked with gathering information (e.g., in environmental monitoring, offshore inspection, and coastal surveillance scenarios). However, in most of these scenarios, human operators must carefully plan the mission to ensure completion of the task. Strict human oversight not only makes such deployments expensive and time consuming but also makes some tasks impossible due to the requirement for heavy cognitive loads or reliable communication between the operator and the vehicle. We can mitigate these limitations by making the robotic information gatherers semi-autonomous, where the human provides high-level input to the system and the vehicle fills in the details on how to execute the plan. In this talk, I will show how a general framework that unifies information theoretic optimization and physical motion planning makes semi-autonomous information gathering feasible in marine environments. In particular, I will discuss results from a recent deployment in the Gulf of Mexico where four underwater gliders and two surface vehicles autonomously mapped an upwelling front using our framework.
